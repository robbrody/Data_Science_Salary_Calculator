## Introduction
I developed an interactive Excel dashboard using Luke Barousse's Job Salary dataset, which includes over 32,000 job postings for Data Science roles worldwide, with a primary emphasis on the United States in 2023. This dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis by calculating the median salary for positions categorized by job title, country, and job schedule type. Users can interact with dropdown filters to customize the data view by job title, country, and schedule. The dashboard features three main visualizations: median salary by job title, job count by country, and median salary by job schedule type. Additionally, KPI cards display key metrics, including the median salary, top job listing platform, and job count based on selected filters. This tool offers an efficient, user-friendly way to explore and analyze job posting data effectively
